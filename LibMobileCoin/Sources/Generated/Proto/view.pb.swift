//// There are several kinds of records returned by the fog view API
//// - RngRecords, which a user can use with their private key to construct KexRng's
//// - TxOutSearchResults, which the user can decrypt with their private key to obtain TxOutRecords
//// - Missed BlockRanges, which tell the user about blocks that fog didn't process,
////   on which they have to fallback to view key scanning. They can download these blocks
////   from the fog-ledger server.
////
//// The TxOut requests ultimately have to be served obliviously to the user in order to meet
//// our definition of privacy. The other two do not.
////
//// A QueryRequest is one request which can represent many logical requests for the above
//// kinds of records. The API is amalgamated in this way to reduce the number of round-trips
//// needed by the client. Note that QueryRequest is actually split into two Protobuf messages:
//// QueryRequest -  which contains sensitive data exchanged over an attested and encrypted connection
//// and QueryRequestAAD - which contains unsensitive data.
//// We split sensitive and unsensitive data since part of the request is fulfilled by untrusted code and part
//// is fulfilled by an enclave.
////
//// The API also supports an important optimization called "cursoring". This means that when
//// you make a request, you tell us "where you were when you visited the API last" and we can
//// avoid searching historical data to give you relevant updates.
////
//// There are two cursors to pay attention to:
//// - start_from_user_event_id - This cursors the events table, allowing the caller to skip events they have already received.
//// - start_from_block_index - This limits the set of blocks in which ETxOutRecords are searched, resulting in less load on the server.
////
//// Missed BlockRanges are reported to you based on whatever cursor value you supply.
//// RngRecords can only be supplied if you supply the user's public view key. We will skip that
//// if you don't.
//// TxOutSearchResults are supplied if you supply fog search keys (outputs from a kex rng) in the get_txos
//// field.
////
//// Example usage:
//// Typically when hitting fog view, you will make a series of requests, not just one.
//// The first one checks for new rng records, and later ones check for new txos in increasingly
//// large numbers, depending on how many responses come back, how many Rng's you have, etc.
////
//// QueryRequest { address_public_key = 0x123..., start_from_block_index = 100, start_from_user_event_id = 100 }
//// QueryRequest { get_txos = { 0x1..., 0x2... }, start_from... }
//// QueryRequest { get_txos = { 0x3..., 0x4..., 0x5..., 0x6.... , start_from...} }
//// QueryRequest { get_txos = { 0x7..., 0x8..., 0x9..., 0x10... , start_from...} }
////
//// It is possible to combine the first get_txos request with the address_public_key request
//// if you already have some Rng's before you make that request.
////
//// The highest_processed_block_count value from the first request in a given session should become the
//// start_from_block_index value the next time you make a request. Similarly, next_start_from_user_event_id should
//// become start_from_user_event_id for the next request.
////
/// After the interaction, you can be sure that you got every Txo of yours up to those cursor values.
////
//// An additional optimizaiton is possible: if doing full wallet recovery and you have no Rngs
//// at all, the request sequence might look like this:
////
//// QueryRequest { address_public_key = 0x123..., start_from_block_index = 0 }
//// QueryRequest { start_from_block_index = 73, get_txos = { 0x1..., 0x2... } }
//// QueryRequest { start_from_block_index = 73, get_txos = { 0x3..., 0x4..., 0x5..., 0x6.... } }
//// QueryRequest { start_from_block_index = 73, get_txos = { 0x7..., 0x8..., 0x9..., 0x10... } }
////
//// The first request has start_from_block_index = 0, and gives back all the Rng records of the user.
//// After inspecting those records, if there are no Rng's with start_block less than 73,
//// then start_from_block_index can be 73 for the rest of the requests, which limits the amount of
//// historical data that must be searched to support the requst.
